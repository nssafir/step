        This map shows the places I have lived and the places I have visited.
        The larger, dark icons show places I have lived and the smaller, light icons show places I have visited.
        You can hover any of these icons to see the names of these places and when I visited or lived in them.
        For places I have lived, you can click on the icons to learn more about my experiences there. 
        Icons are made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com.
