        <b>DELUG Workshop Co-Chair (Spring 2020 - Now) </b> -  As the workshop co-chair of Deep Learning at
        UGA (DELUG), I help develop workshop presentations that we use to inform interested members of the UGA
        community about deep learning. You can look at some of our presentations on the group's <a href="https://delug.github.io/">

        <b>TNO Intern (Summer 2019) </b> -  I worked under Dr. Ernst-Jan Buis this summer at the Netherlands Organization
        for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). My task was creating an ML model to differentiate between high-frequency
        neutrino signals and underwater dolphin harmonics by analyzing hydrophone data from a large international 
        particle physics experiment (KM3NeT). I developed a pipeline in Python using signal processing algorithms and 
        convolutional neural network models and achieved over 99% accuracy in differentiating between dolphin clicks
        and simulated neutrino signals.

        <b>Past Course Projects (Fall 2018 - Spring 2020) </b> -  I have created many applications for the
        computer science courses I have taken at the University of Geogia, including Human Computer Interaction,
        Data Structures, Systems Programming, Computer Architectures, Software Development, and more. Under academic
        honesty guidelines, these projects cannot be made public, but I may be able to provide code upon request.
