        <p> Hello! My name is Nathan Safir. I was born in Chicago (go 'hawks!), but grew up in Kansas City. When I was 16, my family moved to 
            the Netherlands, and I later graduated high school from the American School of the Hague. From there, I went to the 
            University of Georgia as a Foundation Fellow. The Foundation Fellowship has given me several incredible experiences,
            from studying computing ethics at Oxford over a Maymester, to travelling internationally and to New York and DC during spring break,
            and networking with an amazing community of alumni and peers. </p>

        <p> At UGA, I am pursuing majors in computer science and geography. I aim to graduate with a B.S./M.S. in Computer Science and Artificial
            Intelligence and a B.A. in Geography.  I have always enjoyed problem solving and mathematics, so when first learned about machine learning,
            I was instantly hooked. I am especially interested in deep learning, generative modeling, and representational learning. I hope to have a 
            career where I can work on using machine learning for social good. </p>

        <p> Outside of academics my interests include ice hockey (I'm currently coaching a youth team in Athens, GA), reading (follow me on Goodreads!), and 
            trivia (fun fact -- my roomates and I have made over $500 in gift cards from weekly trivia at a local pizza shop). If you would like to chat, please
            reach out to me at nssafir@gmail.com. </p>
